Tonight
on "The Bachelorette"...

Michelle!

This week is Overnights.

I didn't think it was
possible for me

to fall for more than
one person,

but here we are.

I am crazy about you.

I'm falling even more
in love with you.

I am like so in love
with this girl.

This is tough for me.

It wasn't till today
that I realized

I'm not the only one catching
feelings for Michelle.

I feel like we went from
bros to foes.

Do I think Nyate's ready?
No.

Brandon is a good guy,
but I'm her guy.

That's my woman.
That's my wife.

Not yet.

Wanna let these guys know
that's my girl.

I could have stronger
feelings for him

than he does for me.

You think
I'm the weakest link.

You're hurting her.

Falling in love
is one thing.

An engagement
is another thing.

Which of those
are you ready for?

True Nayte
is gonna come out.

You think I could
talk to you?

That changed everything.

And it all starts
right now.

I'm very excited.

This week we are
in Mexico!

It is beautiful.

I cannot believe
I get the opportunity

to finish my journey

at this spot.

The sun is out,
there's palm trees,

we have blue oceans.

These beautiful trees
and canopies

are just, like,
growing everywhere.

And the fact
that I can fall asleep

to the waves
crashing on the shore

has been amazing.

I feel really good
coming to Mexico

to finish falling in love.

This week
is a special week

because this week
is Overnights,

and there's
a lot of emotions

that come with it.

Intimacy is part of it,

but, like, to go
to the Fantasy Suite,

where the cameras are off
and you're able to just have

the conversations
that you want to have.

You can ask the questions
that you need to ask.

That's when you truly
can get to know someone.

And I can only imagine

what it could do
for a relationship.

I have
three incredible men left.

And I am falling in love.

I never thought
that I'd be able

to have those types
of feelings

with more than one person,

but Mexico is the place
where I could be engaged.

These three relationships,

like, they all
are very strong.

But it also makes
my decision more difficult.

I am like,
"Wait a second.

How did we get here
so fast?"

I know.

You know, like,
now that I'm sitting here,

and can see a future
with these three guys,

like, realistically
see a future...

- Yeah.
- Like, it's a lot.

- Yeah.
- It's a lot.

So, you've got
Nayte, Brandon, and Joe.

- Yes.
- So tell me

how you're feeling
about Brandon.

Brandon and I have

an incredibly strong
connection,

and he has always worn
his heart on his sleeve.

Like, from day one,

he's been vulnerable,
he's been open.

So, Brandon has told you
he's falling in love with you.

You've said
the same thing back.

Do you have any concerns
with Brandon?

Honestly, no.

- Uh‐uh, not one?
- No.

That would be a really
beautiful relationship then.

- Yes.
- Okay, well now I feel

like saying "Game over,"
but no.

- You've got two others...
- There's still two.

That I know you feel
strong about.

Yes.

So, Joe and I,
right off the bat,

had a lot in common,
just because of, like,

basketball,
we're both from Minnesota.

There's just this part
of each other

that we understand

that I feel like
nobody else does.

I know Joe's
a little more reserved,

so has he opened up
and told you

how he feels about you?

Yes.
Joe has actually told me

that he's falling
in love with me.

Oh, he did.
Okay, good.

And I think
what I'm looking for,

like, in Overnights
with him,

is that we continue
to progress

our feelings
about falling for each other.

But what I have seen,
I've loved.

- Yeah.
- Everything that I've seen

about him I've loved.

And then you have Nayte.

Then I have Nayte.

Nayte caught my eye
right away.

But it was more of, like,
how our conversation went.

Like, yes, he is
a very good‐looking dude.

- Yeah.
- But, like, he has

so much depth to him

and he grew up
in a family

where they didn't say
"I love you."

Mm‐hmm.

But for me
in a relationship,

like, I do want
to hear those words.

And especially with something
as big as an engagement.

- Yeah.
- And so, like,

is that something
that's gonna be a challenge...

- Right.
- To actually be able

to say, like,
"I'm in love with you."

- Right.
- Or feeling like

- I'm in love with you.
- That's a valid concern.

And so, could I end up
in a situation

where I have fallen more
for the other person

once again?
Yeah, I could.

- Oh, that's scary.
- I don't know.

- Yeah.
- And that's a concern?

That Nayte could,
down the road,

- break your heart?
- Yeah, if he's not‐‐yeah.

If he's not ready.

Really pay attention
to those fears with Nayte,

because I wish I did that
a little bit more.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

Okay.

It's weird being
in the room

with both Brandon
and Nayte.

At this point,
we're all getting

closer and closer
to Michelle

and our relationships
are getting more serious.

And so we're
not really friends,

'cause we're competing
for the same girl.

So now we like kind of went
from bros to foes,

and, like, it is awkward,
very awkward.

- Oh, why, hello!
- Hello.

How is everyone feeling?

Good.

Michelle could not be
happier with you three.

She really does see
her husband here.

But at the end
of the day,

only one of you
will be Michelle's fiancé.

So, let's talk
about this week.

I think it's
the most important week

of Michelle's journey,
and yours,

because it really
can change everything.

Each of you will have
a romantic, intimate,

one‐on‐one date
with Michelle.

And if you are lucky enough

for her to offer
the Fantasy Suite card,

you will have the opportunity
to have the night with her.

I know this week in my journey
was huge for me.

Like, I could not wait
to be behind closed doors,

no cameras, just like have
all the pressure off

- and just really dive in.
- Yeah.

It's an indescribable
feeling.

So I truly, like, hope

you guys really give it
your all,

'cause it could be
the beginning

of something really special.

So, if you are
still guarding yourself,

protecting yourself,
having walls up with emotions,

let go.

If you have something
you want to say

to Michelle, say it.

Because truthfully,
it could be like

the key piece
between a tearful goodbye

and really starting
something special

and a lifetime of happiness
with Michelle.

So have fun,

and I have the first date card.

I'll leave it right here.

Hope we see you all
at the Rose Ceremony.

- Bye, guys.
- Thank you, Tayshia.

Bye.

It's definitely
a pivotal week.

So everybody's hoping
for the net.

You know, you just want
to go see Michelle.

I'd prefer to go first,

just because
it has been a while

since I've seen Michelle,

so I'm definitely,
definitely looking forward

to seeing her.

"Brandon,

"Let's ride off into
the sunset,

heart Michelle."

Being the first date,

and possible first
Fantasy Suite,

it's just huge.
It's, like...

like she wanted me
to go first.

Oh, man.

I'm so excited
and so nervous, you know?

Just, like, a whole
different level of confidence,

and, like, that's
what our relationship is.

All right, guys.
I gotta get ready for my date.

Enjoy Mexico.

Seeing Brandon
go off on a date

with the person
that I'm falling in love with

is a little tough.

There's a lot of emotions.

I think it sucks
for both me and Nayte.

You know, you want
that first opportunity

to, you know, get
that deeper connection

with Michelle.

This process has been
a rollercoaster of emotions

and so you kind of
just have to

stay in the moment,
understand that your time

is gonna come,
and be ready for that

when it does.

I'm just so excited
to see Michelle.

I'm excited to pick up
where we last left off.

I mean, the connection
with her and me is unreal,

and I think this date
is most importantly

just elevating
our relationship.

On my Hometown date,
I told Michelle

that I'm falling
in love with her.

And each day it grows
stronger, and stronger,

and stronger
until the next time

you see her,
it, like, doubles.

Hi.

How are we doing?

- Good, how are you?
- Good!

I'm crazy
about this woman.

I'm just so stoked.
She's all to myself.

I'm ready.

I'm ready to ride off
into the sunset.

Mm.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

- Well...
- You look good.

- Welcome to Mexico.
- Thank you.

This is your first time,
right?

First time leaving
the country.

Yeah.

- Okay.
- Well, we might be having

a day of firsts.
I love that.

- Okay.
- Are you ready?

Yeah, I'm excited.

All right, let's go.

Oh, my God.

So those are our friends,
huh?

I love it.

Have you ever been
on a horse?

This is the closest
I've ever been to a horse.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Okay, so we have
Tomate,

which is gonna be
your horse, right here.

- Okay, all right.
- And then mine over there,

that's Panini.

- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

Okay, ready?

Yo, we're going
horseback riding.

I don't have an inner cowboy,

but my inner cowboy came out,
and I was like...

Let's ride.

- Okay. Cowboy style.
- Yep.

- Cowboy up.
- Ready?

- Oh ho!
- Ooh!

- Like a pro!
- Chill, Tomate.

- Yo, what do I do?
- All right, Brandon,

- give a little kick.
- Chill, chill, chill,

chill, chill.

No. He just wants to‐‐
he's doing this own thing.

Oh, hold, hold, hold.

Well, this was
supposed to be,

you know,
a date with the couple.

Yee‐haw.

You look like a natural,
Brandon.

Yeah, you know.

Tomate just needed
a little‐‐

He needed a little warm‐up.
You know?

Yeah, you need
a little warm‐up.

Little warm‐up.

It's so beautiful.

He's cruisin' back there.

- Yeah.
- Me and Tomate are clickin'

- right now.
- Clickin'?

Brandon and I

have so much fun together.

Yeah.
Good boy.

Nice and easy.

- I'm a cowboy for sure.
- Nice and easy.

Brandon was the guy

who rolled up on a bed
in his Jordan sneakers.

I was like, "Okay."

Like, this guy's
a smooth‐talker,

he's a player, he's‐‐
you know,

I really wasn't sure
about Brandon.

But, uh, it took what?
Two conversations

and I was like, "Okay, this
guy's the real deal."

I'm actually having a blast.

- So cool, right?
- Yeah.

I continue to be
more and more surprised

by Brandon every day.

He's just somebody
that I can see

being my best friend.

And I think that's

one of the most important
things to look for

when searching
for a soul mate.

Oh, my God, this is pretty.

- What?
- Wow, that is beautiful.

Oh, my God.
What?

This is beautiful.

We would be a good‐looking...

Cowboy couple
Duo, you know?

Yo, this is, like,
the most romantic thing

I think I've ever done
with someone

in my entire life.

Being with Michelle,
I realized, like,

it's just no matter
where I am, just with her,

everything is so perfect
and beautiful.

Whoo!

I'm literally the luckiest man
in the world right now.

Since the last time
I said goodbye to you,

like, that's always been it.

It's just when's
the next time I can see you,

and then when's
the next time I can hold you

and spend the day with you?

So, I mean, of course I want

to, like, be with you
all night

and hold you and talk to you,

without everyone,
but this is my favorite part.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

Mine too.

Just because, like,
if we sit and think

about that first night,
it wasn't that long ago,

but it seems like years ago.

Forever ago, forever ago.

Now, I feel like
I know you.

Yeah.

I feel like our families
are very similar.

Yeah, I'm happy
that I was able to meet them.

- Yeah.
- Do you feel like

- it went well?
- I think it went

extremely well.

Like, I've never seen my‐‐

the things my family said,
that was the first time,

like, I've ever heard them
like that.

They've never been, like,
"Hey, Michelle, like,

"We've always been
a family of four,

but now we have an open spot
if you want it."

Like, just to hear that‐‐

They've never said
that to anyone, so‐‐

Like, you saw all of me.
And then you saw my family.

Like, they trust
all of me to you,

and it's just, like,
am I good enough, you know?

Like, that thought
crossed my mind.

I think‐‐
If you're good enough?

Yeah, or just, like‐‐
Well, I hope

I can answer that for you now.

- Oh, no, you don't have to.
- No question.

You are one of a kind,
and I recognize that.

You mean the world to me.

I am like so in love
with this girl.

She's walked through
my heart.

She's seen it all,
she's seen me for me.

And spending the day
with her,

like, I got that reassurance.

I love being with this woman.

Super excited about tonight.

I hope that I get
to go to the Fantasy Suite.

But, at the same time,

I'm just so scared,
'cause, like,

as much as me
and Michelle have connected

and the chemistry is there‐‐

I still wonder
am I enough or not?

It's definitely weird

that whatever date
that they're on

could lead to Overnights.

Yeah.

I don't know, like, it's weird,

but at the same time,
like, I'm not gonna lie,

haven't really thought
about it.

I've been thinking about, like,

looking forward to my time,
you know what I mean?

Like, you gotta just focus
on yourself, really.

- Yeah.
- And that's why it is weird,

but I can't say that it's hard.

I'm feeling good, man,
I'm still feeling good,

you know?

This whole time,
not once have I ever stopped

to think about
other people's relationships

with Michelle,
'cause at the end of the day,

you don't know
what you don't know,

so why are you gonna
stress about it?

You know what I mean?
So it's, like,

you made it this far
off of something

that's legitimate and genuine,

so just bet on that,
continue that.

I'm just trying
to stay distracted

from thinking
about what she's doing

with Brandon, so‐‐
Yeah.

- Hi.
- You look so beautiful.

- Look at you.
- Hi.

This entire day
has been so truly amazing.

And I'm super excited
about tonight.

Can't wait to...

literally rip out my heart,

throw it on the table,
and say,

"Just do what you want with it,

'cause it only beats for you
at this point.

- Where were we?
- I was gonna say...

When I fall for someone
this hard,

I truly fall for 'em.

And my heart is 100% all in.

- Ooh, okay.
- Yeah, you know?

I like it.

I'm not here to leave
anything off the table.

Tonight I'm gonna tell
Michelle Anne Young

that I'm in love with her.

I just wanna let you know,
like, this is just truly a day

I don't think
I'm ever gonna forget.

And, you know,
it got to spend it

with the most beautiful
and special person to me.

I got to, you know,
be in Mexico

for the first time with you.

Got to hold you by the beach,
and it's just so lucky.

Like, you have no idea
how lucky I feel, and...

just every time
I'm with you, like,

my heart just grows.

And, you know, just I...

I don't want to be
with anyone else

other than you, Michelle.

I'm trying not
to make eye contact.

Once we get started‐‐
I want to kiss you.

Gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss.

How do you feel about just‐‐

like at the beginning of this,
like, walking into it,

you know that everybody's
talking about

this big thing,
like, at the end

like where it's an engagement

or it's like
a life‐long promise,

and it's this thing

that's like
off in the distance.

But, like, now it's tangible.
It's, like, within reach.

Yeah.

Is it realistic
for you to be able

to get to that point?

Since day one
when I met you,

I knew that you were the one.

And when it hit,
and when I truly knew was...

randomly
when we were getting ice cream.

Michelle, I want you to know
that I'm in love with you.

I‐I was gonna wait,

but I don't want
to wait anymore.

I want you to know how I feel,

that I'm truly
in love with you.

It just, like‐‐

I'm just so sick
of keeping it in.

'Cause I want you
to know, like,

I will always,
always put you first.

Always.

Till I take my last breath,
I will put you first.

You are such a big part
in my world now.

And I know
we're not at the end yet,

but I'm not gonna leave here
without telling you that,

looking you in the eye
and seeing that smile.

I'm in love with you.

I am.
And everything about you.

- I'm, like‐‐my heart is...
- Yeah.

- Beating so fast right now.
- Yeah.

Yeah, you should have felt
my heart when...

Yeah.

So‐‐
I mean,

I don't want
to take off running.

- That's a good sign.
- That's a good sign.

Okay, cool, cool.

But I meant what I said

after meeting your family.

That I'm falling in love
with you.

And that's not something
I say lightly.

It's not something
that I feel easily.

But I do see a future with you.

I just‐‐I've never met somebody

who...
has made me feel so safe.

Like, has made my heart
feel so safe.

- I love that.
- And I'm really excited

about that.
'Cause I have not felt that.

I like that though.

Brandon shared with me
that he loves me,

and he actually said
those words,

"I'm in love with you."

It felt really good.

It felt amazing and exciting.

Brandon is soul mate material.

But on top of that,

we also have
this incredible spark

and, like, burning
passion chemistry

between each other.

That makes me able to
see a future with him.

So... so the night's
obviously not over.

Okay.

This is for you.

It's just a thank you card.
I'm just kidding.

"Michelle and Brandon,

"Your connection is undeniable.

"We hope today's date
here in beautiful Mexico

"only strengthened it.

"Should you choose to forego
your individual rooms,

"please use this key
to stay as a couple

in the Fantasy Suite.
Tayshia and Kaitlyn."

This is huge.

I just‐‐

Sorry, my heart is pounding
super hard right now.

I'm crazy about you.

I want to kiss you,
I want to hold you.

I want to wake up next to you.

- So, that's a yes?
- Yes.

Can I stay
the night with you?

I found something
that I've never found

in my entire life.

When I'm with Michelle,

literally,
the world melts away.

And her telling me, you know,

what her heart was feeling,
meant so much to me.

- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

- Okay.
- Okay.

I like it.

So happy.

I've never been this happy
in my entire life.

Oh... my... goodness.

I truly, truly
am deeply in love

with Michelle Anne Young.

And I feel like tonight
can take

me and Michelle's relationship
to the next level.

If Michelle chooses me,
this is gonna be forever.

My God.

I've been so focused

on my connection
with Michelle,

that, like, it wasn't
till tonight

that I stopped
and realized, like,

oh, I'm literally
not the only one, like,

literally catching
feelings for Michelle.

Tonight was a reality check.

Spending the night
with you‐‐

it's like the most amazing
feeling in the world.

I feel like,
in those moments

where it's, like,
I just don't know

if there's more to learn,

like, there's always
more to learn.

- And I love that.
- Yeah.

Waking up this morning
with Brandon,

I had a smile on my face.

The moment, like, my eyes
shot open,

I was, like, excited
that Brandon was there.

And he is somebody
who is becoming my best friend,

and who I have gotten
really close with.

And last night at dinner,

Brandon shared with me
that he's in love with me.

Not only did it make

my feelings
for Brandon stronger,

but I definitely know
that when Brandon says

those three words,
that he means it.

It's hard for me
to be an open person.

And I feel like
I was definitely able

to open up to you,
to, like, feel that comfort

and, like, that safety
that we talked about.

I appreciate that.

Like, I don't know if you‐‐

If words can really describe,
like, how much

it meant to me
that you just, like, listened

and comforted me
when I needed your comfort.

And you spoke
when you needed to speak.

And, yeah, I don't think

anyone could have
responded better.

Waking up to Michelle
this morning,

I felt the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

This is what I want
to do every day.

Wow.
Look at you.

I got the perfect glimpse
of what life would be like,

and that was
the best feeling in the world.

Whipped up something special.

Our relationship,

it's never gonna be boring,
it's never gonna be simple,

and it's never gonna be
the same as everyone else's.

Mm-hmm.

- In.
- I need-

Sorry.

You wouldn't.

You just put empanada
all over my face.

It's just, like,
little crumbs.

I'll pick 'em up, I promise.

You know how I said
I'm a button‐pusher?

You're so‐‐

Leave it up
to Brandon and I

to have a food fight
in our hotel room.

We're playful,
we have so much fun together.

Whether we are kissing,

have empanada
sliding down our faces,

or having a heart to heart,

this relationship
seems like it has it all.

I am going to miss you.

Coming into this,
I wanted to meet someone

who would take care of me,
would take care of my heart.

All right, bye.

There are people who say
"I would do anything for you,"

and then there are people
like Brandon.

After last night,
Brandon has given me

quite a lot to think about.

Perfect.

I have no idea what
that man might be doing

or thinking or feeling
right now. Who knows?

I just‐‐I just don't see how

we can really speculate,
so I don't know.

Hopefully it's not as good

as the night
that I'll have with Michelle.

That's the only thing
you can really hope for

or think about, so‐‐
Mm‐hmm.

Yo.
What is up?

Are you right here?

What's good?

This is just awkward.

How was your night?

I'm not gonna tell you
details about what happened.

I'm not gonna tell you
anything about yesterday.

Went on a date.

At this point
it's like,

someone went out on a date
with your girlfriend,

and they spent
the night together.

It's a little bit
of a gut punch.

Sitting here has never felt
that awkward before.

Silence right now
is deafening.

You know, it's just‐‐
it's pretty weird.

And I don't think
anybody wants

to, like, share their emotions
or their feelings right now.

I think we're all just,
you know,

trying to play it safe

and not, like, show
each other our cards.

What'd your card say?

It said, "Joe,

we're falling for each other,
Michelle."

All right boys,

I better go get ready
for my date.

Seeing Joe leave,
it was frustrating,

it was frustrating.

You know, after having
our whole night

and everything, and waking up
in the morning next to her,

knowing that she is going
on these other dates

and everything like that
sucks.

I mean, it's just like
torture.

Trying to stay optimistic,
but also it's hard to.

I haven't seen Michelle
since the last Rose Ceremony.

I'm just really excited
to see her again

and spend more time with her.

Last week was
super monumental.

The fact that she got
to meet my family

and my family got to meet her
and learn more about her

really just was a big step
in the relationship.

But today might be
the most important date

I've ever had,
and I'm really excited.

Last week I told Michelle

that I was falling
in love with her.

And every time
that I'm with her,

my feelings have gotten
stronger and stronger.

But I'm a pretty introverted
type of person,

laid back guy.

I'm kind of the quiet one
in the group.

You know, and it's taken
me a little bit to warm up.

Going into today,

I want to just be as open as
possible to Michelle.

I'm gonna put everything
out there.

I want her to know the whole
me and the real me.

Michelle.

- What up?
- Hi.

- How's it going?
- Mm.

- I missed you.
- My Minnesota Joe in Mexico.

As soon as I saw Joe,

it just put
a smile on my face

and it made me so excited.

So good to see you too.

Joe and I have moved

at a little bit
of a slower pace,

which is not a bad thing.

But this engagement
is around the corner.

So, I have a picnic
planned for us.

- Okay.
- Only problem is

the picnic's
all the way down there.

All the way down there?

So we have to get down there.

How are we getting
down there?

- We're gonna go find out.
- Let's go find out.

Let's do it.

- I'm so excited.
- Me too.

Last week,
Joe told me

he was falling in love
with me.

I do feel like I'm right there,

and I hope that today
is gonna be that point

where I can finally say

that I'm falling in love
with Joe as well.

Have you been
zip‐lining before?

- I have never been zip‐lining.
- You haven't?

- Never.
- Yes!

- So this is your first time.
- This is my first time.

- Okay, good.
- Okay.

It's kind of shaky.

- Trust, right?
- Trust.

- Ready?
- I mean, I'll be a gentleman

- and let ladies go first.
- Perfect.

- I'll go first!
- Okay.

Love is scary,
zip‐lining's scary,

but I'm ready to do whatever
to win Michelle's heart.

- Bye.
- Scream it out.

Whoo!

You got this!

Oh, my God.

This is so cool!

I'm a very energetic person,
very upbeat.

That was so cool.

And, you know, Joe's

a little more
of a quiet person.

But that's okay.

Ahh!

Oh, my God.

Michelle!

Let's go, Joe!

Okay.

It does feel good
to just let loose and scream

and just be whatever
the moment takes you.

Whoo!

Oh, my God.

Zip‐lining with Joe
is so much fun.

He is way more vocal
than I thought he would be.

See ya!

Whoo.

Oh, my God, this is great!

- Let's go, Michelle.
- You got this!

Doing this amazing
adventurous thing

with Michelle,
I can picture a future

of us doing more adventurous
things together.

Whoo!

He shouts the longest.

I see Michelle definitely
being the person

that could push me
out of my comfort zone.

Michelle!

I'm coming for you!

Every time that I'm getting
more moments with Michelle,

I get to learn
more and more about her,

but I also, you know,
learn more

about, you know, the things

- that we have in common.
- Good job.

And so I just want
to be as open as possible

in the time
that we do have together.

So did you ever think

that you could be
this vulnerable?

Nope. I didn't think‐‐
I didn't think so.

I didn't think so.

You know, you have helped me
open up

and be more the real me.

I don't necessarily
just open up to people

like I have with you,
but you make it easy.

And I think that's because
of the chemistry that we have

and the connection
that we've built together.

I feel like today
I've seen, just‐‐

I've seen
so many different sides of you.

Mm‐hmm.

- Like your adventure side.
- And you are goofy!

Yeah, I just gotta be put

in the right goofy environment,
I guess, but‐‐

Yeah, I guess I'm just
kind of slow

- to warm up in general...
- Yeah.

Sometimes it could be just

the thing of being scared
of being

the true self,
that you don't want,

like, to turn someone off,
or you don't know

if they really, like‐‐
Yeah.

How they would really
perceive that side of you.

Well, I like the goofy side.

And you should definitely bring
the goofy side out more.

- And I needed this date today.
- Mm‐hmm.

'Cause, like, you've been
just, like,

this little slice of home.

I mean, you definitely
bring that for me,

and I think
that's really important.

And so today, like, I do,
I feel less homesick.

- Same.
- I've felt the same way.

Every time
that I have felt lonely,

or felt, you know, homesick,
when I'm with you

those feelings
pretty much go away.

I have very strong
feelings for Joe.

I've loved everything
that I have seen of Joe.

It's just taken longer

for me to see those sides.

This is definitely a moment

that I will never forget,
though.

I think, even going
into tonight,

there's just so much more
to learn about him.

They are hungry.

They are so hungry.

And hopefully that
is what would give me

the clarity to see
if he could be

somebody I see spending
the rest of my life with.

Hold on.
Sit.

All right.

Did you just tell
the horse to sit?

Today was
definitely everything

I was expecting it to be
and even more.

I don't think I've ever felt
this way about somebody.

I feel that I'm falling

more and more in love
with Michelle.

And so I'm just hoping
that, you know,

going into tonight,
we just continue to build

on what we've had already.

I want her to know
I'm ready for marriage,

I'm ready for a partnership,

I'm ready
for building a life together.

Today was, I think,
a big day for me

because I saw
the energetic, upbeat, Joe.

I saw the relaxed,
adventurous side.

I can feel my emotions
and my feelings for him

growing stronger and stronger.

Joe is a 1,000‐piece puzzle.

And I like puzzles.

- Hi.
- Hey.

- Wow, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

- How are you?
- Good.

- How are you doing?
- I'm great.

I feel like
I definitely have

all of the end pieces,

I have most of the middle,

and I'm searching
for the last few pieces.

Today was so meaningful for me

and helped me
get a lot of clarity

with where our relationship
is at,

and where I feel like
it could be headed.

So thank you for continuing

to open up to me,
continuing to be vulnerable,

and I loved every minute of it.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

I'm really glad
you got to see

another side of me.

I wasn't sure,
when you were zip‐lining,

I wasn't sure if
you were going to, like, scream

while you went down.

What, you thought
I'd just be silent?

Maybe!

Just, like, quiet, just no...

Oh, my God,
that'd be so awkward.

No. No, that was really fun.

Okay, so you're
extremely introverted,

I already knew that part.

How do you feel about
being with somebody

who is insanely extroverted?

Yeah, I think it's good.

I think the fact
that you are extroverted

I think helps
bring a side of me out

that I didn't think
is necessarily always there.

- Aww.
- And so, you know,

I think we work well together.

How many kids
do you want, Joe?

I'm‐‐I'm‐‐
The ideal number.

- The ideal?
- Mm‐hmm.

I want three,
but I'm open to having

two and two,
so, like, three to four?

- Three is a solid number.
- Yeah.

Kind of one of the reasons
I got into real estate

was 'cause I wanted to set

not only myself up
for the future,

but, you know, set the
foundation for a family.

And, you know, I want
to be an inspiration

to others.

I think my story,

as well as other athletes,
is, you know,

a lot of people
kind of get lost

after their sport.

And so I want to be able
to be, you know, like,

an example for others
to show that, you know,

the tools and everything
that we learned

through our athletics
is something

that we can definitely bring
into the real world.

- Yeah.
- And to influence

and ultimately change
the world.

And so that's
kind of like my why.

- That's what I want.
- I want a life

that is impactful.

Making a difference
is incredibly important to me.

- Mm‐hmm.
- And I think it's incredible

that that's kind of
how you think as well.

Like, having someone
to ping ideas off of,

and having two people
going at it

instead of, you know,
just one is...

I don't know.

Ringing very close to home
for me right now.

- Mm‐hmm.
- I like that.

I feel like we would be

a really powerful couple
together.

Yo, today
is definitely tough, you know?

- I feel good, man.
- I feel good.

Like, I was thinking
about it, like,

I think third
is the best spot to go, man.

I'm chilling right now.

If I was in Michelle's spot,
if I was in Michelle's spot,

In what world
is third best to go?

No, no, no. If I was, like‐‐
no, no, check me out.

I would want‐‐
personally, this is just me‐‐

my closest connection
to be the last guy.

Why is that?

Just because you already know
there's a connection there.

Like, you're gonna want
your deepest connection first.

So are you saying
that you think

I'm the weakest link?

No, I don't say
that you're the weakest link.

I just say, like,
you're good now

because you don't understand,
that's the thing.

'Cause I'm seeing
that you're slightly stressed

about Joe, then you gotta
slightly stress about Nayte.

Trust me,
I'm not stressed at all.

You know what it's like,
and you know

that Joe's up next,
and then Nayte's up.

No, it's just, like,
you don't want your girl

to be with, like‐‐
So I get to go into it

naive, naive,
this is what it's like.

You're like,
I know what it's like.

Damn, Joe's now doing that.
Damn, Nayte's now doing that.

You know what I mean?

The only reason I care
is because I care

about Michelle
and I want to marry her.

It's definitely tough knowing

that Joe's taking my girl
out on a date, you know?

After having the first date,

and the first, like,
Overnight and everything,

and everything going good,

and then all the sudden, like,
you go into the next day

- and she's with another dude.
- Yeah.

And you're just like,
yeah, okay.

You thinking
about Joe right now?

I couldn't ask
for a better day.

I'm really glad
we got to spend it together.

It really felt special.

I always feel connected
to you,

but today was
just on a different level.

So, I have
a little surprise for you.

- Okay.
- Oh.

Open it up.

"Michelle and Joe,
we hope today

"was magical for you both

"and brought you two
even closer together.

"Should you choose to forego
your individual rooms,

"please use this key
to stay as a couple

in the Fantasy Suite.
Tayshia and Kaitlyn."

I am 100% on board if you are.

I would love to be able
to have that time with you.

- Let's do it.
- Perfect.

I think every time
I'm more and more surprised

with just how similar
Joe and I both are.

I've always said, like,
I am here to find

my person that's going
to change the world with me.

And I didn't realize

how much Joe was
already on that journey

of changing the world.

Having spent today together
has really shown me

how much we connect,
where our similarities are,

where we would also
balance each other out.

And so I feel like I got

a lot of the answers
I was looking for.

Sucks to know
that Joe's on a date,

but at the end of the day,
it's like,

- what can you do about it?
- Yeah.

She's dating two other guys,
you know what I mean?

- Yeah.
- And, like, that's

my woman, that's my wife
in my mind, and so‐‐

Not yet.

I've already accepted
the fact

that, you know what?
I believe I'm gonna be the one

ending up with Michelle.

Here we are.

But I also know
that she absolutely, 100%

is having a huge connection
with two other guys here.

I have to face that.

And so, you know, seeing that,

you kind of get into your head

and you think, like,
oh, maybe she already has,

like, the person picked out
who she wants to be with,

and it might be Nayte
or it might be Joe.

Cheers to falling in love
in Mexico.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Now she's with Joe
having a great night,

and she's gonna have
a great time with Nayte.

And that's a tough pill
to swallow.

What do you think
they're doing right now?

I don't know.

I know at the end,
she's gonna find happiness.

She's gonna find her person.

I just hope it's me.

She's everything,
and she's my everything,

and, you know, I'm just scared
to lose her.

- How did you sleep?
- Good.

- Good?
- How did you sleep?

Could have used a couple more
hours of sleep.

I love that you're a morning
person.

I am a morning person.

Mm‐hmm. Same.

But I wanted to just say
thank you

for continuing to be
vulnerable and open with me.

I know it's not easy.

And I hope you know that
I meant what I said.

- Mm‐hmm.
- With where my feelings are at

and how strong I'm feeling
about you.

And I loved being able to see,
like, realistically

what waking up next to Joe
would feel like.

Mm‐hmm.

Definitely something
I could get used to.

Good.

I'm falling even more
in love with you

every moment that we get
together.

I feel how strong
my feelings

have grown for Joe overnight.

And seeing who Joe really was,
like, when cameras were off

and just, like,
this relaxed, fun‐‐

this kindhearted person.

Oh, a little breakfast.

- Little breakfast.
- Aww.

Joe is my slice of home.

Maybe my soulmate.

I definitely have
breakfast next time.

- I got you.
- You got me?

- I'll repay the favor.
- There's a next time?

- Mm‐hmm.
- Okay.

I love that.

I hope you know how much,
like, I care about you

and how much you mean to me

and I know this has not been
easy for you,

but I really do appreciate you
pushing through

your shy side.

And if it is us, like,
standing side by side

at the end of this,

that relationship's
gonna be so strong.

I wouldn't want it
any other way.

I'm falling more and more
in love with Michelle.

And after last night, I wanted
her to know how real it is

and how, like, serious I am

to potentially be married
with Michelle.

I'm ready.

I'm very ready.

I can see a future with you.

And I could really
see this working.

I'm trying to find
my life partner,

and 24 hours, Joe has changed
everything.

Besos, besos, besos.

Now I feel like I have
so much to think about

because after spending time
with Joe,

I feel like I have clarity,
which...

is exciting,
which is terrifying,

Which makes my decision even
harder than it already was.

- I feel good, man.
- Yeah?

I feel good.

- You excited for your date?
- Hell yeah.

Hell yeah.

How do you think the date went?

- Good.
- Good?

Yeah.

For Joe it's probably the same.

Like, when you go through
it all

and you have that experience,
it's beautiful.

You realize, like, how bad you
truly want it. So...

Mm.

- What up?
- How's it going, guys?

How you living?

- I'm good.
- Good.

Feeling good, living better.

- Feeling good, living better.
- Yes, sir.

How was the date?

- The date was good.
- It was super cool.

Um, ended up going to the
Fantasy Suite for the night.

It was great.
So had a good time and it was‐‐

it was fun.

All right, guys, I'm 'bout to
go get ready for my date.

Yeah, I don't know where
his head's at.

We're here in Mexico, and he's
had to wait the whole week.

So‐‐so I don't know
how he'll be on his date.

Who knows?

I told Michelle I'm falling
in love with her,

and Brandon told Michelle
the same.

But so far, we haven't really
seen Nayte

open up with Michelle.

Like, we're down to three,
you know what I mean?

He's for sure thinking
about it.

If it doesn't affect you,
then do you care

that much for Michelle?
'Cause it's gotta affect you.

Do I think Nayte's ready?
No, I don't.

I don't know what goes on
in their talks,

but you gotta deal with your
emotions and your feelings,

because she does need to know
where your heart's at.

Otherwise at the end,
you're hurting her.

True Nayte
is gonna come out, you know?

- Mm‐hmm.
- We'll see.

We'll see.

I'm feeling good, man.

I'm just happy that
I am about to spend

the entire day with Michelle.

How fast I'm catching feelings
for Michelle‐‐

this is all new to me.

But just being, like,
locked in on Michelle

definitely just helps you
kind of remain

cool, calm and collected.

The last time I saw Michelle
was Hometown dates.

So it's been some time.
Missing her like crazy.

So I can't wait to
get this started.

I'm just taking in
the scenery,

looking at all these really
nice boats.

I'm like, "Okay, like,
where is Michelle?"

Oh, look at this.

Oh, yo.

Hi.

Now, you're gonna have to
drive faster.

I miss you.

- I know.
- It's been way too long.

It's been way too long.

Boat pulled up, and got to
finally meet my girl again.

Hi, girl. How you doing?
How you doing? How you doing?

Mm.

Cruising.

Look at this.

This is amazing.

Whenever Michelle and I
are together,

it's just the life‐‐

there in that moment,
two people

only focused on each other.

- I missed you.
- I missed you.

I think I've said it
a hundred times.

I've said it a hundred times
already.

Nayte and I chillin' up on
the front of the catamaran.

This sets the bar high

because there is nothing better
than hanging out with this man

in the middle of Mexico,

in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean.

Honestly, it was perfect.

- You got the gas.
- I got the gas.

I got the steering.

- Look at you.
- Captain Michelle.

You got it. You got it.

We get to sit in the
captain's seat and take over.

We get to put up the sails.

Pull it. Pull it.

Dang, this is a workout.

Whatever comes our way,

when I'm with Nayte I feel

how you're supposed to feel
when you're with your soulmate.

When you're with, like,
your favorite person.

I don't want the day to end.

I just want to spend time
with him.

This week was challenging.

You know, I did stop
and I thought about

your connection
with some of these other guys.

But I just took it
moment by moment

and I knew that my time
with you was coming.

I think part of, like,
being...

you know, present is, like,

accepting
uncomfortable feelings

that you're currently
experiencing.

- Yeah.
- You know?

Going through it,
it is difficult.

You could sit and think about
the other connections

and that could drive you crazy.

That could, you know,
all these different things.

Like, it's not in your control.

That part's not
in your control.

Your control is, you know,
when you get to

spend time together and‐‐
Yeah.

But hey, like, I'm next to you
right now,

so how upset can I really be?

Yeah. Yeah.

I am crazy about you.

I'm really crazy
about you too.

Wow. You are something else.

I can definitely see us
doing life together.

Yeah?

Just like the very little
things about you.

- Mm.
- You know, just, like,

very, very, very subtle things

that make each human being.

Yes.

I really like the little,
subtle things that make you...

Michelle.

Kissing Nayte is magical,

and I've never had a feeling
like when I kiss Nayte.

I just can't get enough
of this.

I'm very crazy about Nayte.

Once we're together, it's like
we did not miss a beat.

But this whole engagement
thing is a week away.

And it's important for me
to know if he can get there.

Going into tonight,
the biggest thing

that I need to hear
is if he loves me.

If it were a perfect world,

Nayte would say that tonight.

But if he can't get there,

I will be incredibly
heartbroken.

Oh, Nayte's on his date
today.

How do you think he's doing?

All I know is hopefully
it isn't going

- as well as mine went.
- Yeah.

I'm sure you're thinking
the same way.

- Yeah.
- I mean, I haven't asked Nayte

where his head is at,

but if you're really ready
to settle down

with someone for life,

you should really be
opening up.

I don't think he will.

Today was an unbelievable
date per usual

when I spend time with Nayte.

And, uh, that puts a lot of
pressure on tonight.

Because I need to know exactly
where Nayte is at.

Last time I saw Nayte,

I was able
to meet Nayte's family.

And his stepdad, Charles,
said that

he's not sure if Nayte's
gonna have this moment

where he freezes and gets
scared about what's to come.

I feel like it was a super
pivotal moment for me

because there is definitely
a lot of nerves

behind the fact that
I could potentially

have stronger feelings
for him than he does for me.

And so from Nayte tonight,

I wanna know where
his feelings are at.

Wow.

- Hi.
- How are you?

You look amazing.

You look amazing.

- How are you doing?
- How are you doing?

Tonight, the perfect evening
would be

if Nayte can truly tell me

he is ready for an
engagement at the end of this.

- Thank you.
- I got you.

There's a lot on the line.

So tonight, I'm gonna ask
the hard questions.

So do you have a lot on your
mind to talk about?

Um, not really, no.

- No?
- No.

- Nothing?
- Nothing too pressing.

- Nothing too pressing.
- Mm‐kay.

So there is this pressure,

there's this engagement
at the end‐‐

- Mm‐hmm.
- Where, you know,

- it is quick.
- Yeah.

And I wanna know
exactly where you are at.

Okay, so I guess
I do have

a lot to unpack tonight.

Um...

So... you know, this last week

has been really, really...

amazing for me in the sense of

having that time to really just
think about my feelings.

Mm‐hmm.

And...

when, you know,
we had that Hometown date

and had my mom over
and my stepdad,

- you know, family time...
- Yeah.

- That was huge.
- That was huge for me.

And, you know, sitting with my
mom, sitting with Charles,

definitely like a lot of
serious questions were asked.

You know, um, even, like,

"How do you know that life
after this

"when you exit this environment
is gonna be kind of the same?

"Like, how do you know
that feelings

- will kind of translate..."
- Yeah.

"When this is all
said and done?"

And, um...

after being able to kind of
think about these questions...

that I don't have answers to‐‐
Yeah.

- That's life, though.
- You know what I mean?

Like, that's life to me,
and if you have

all the answers to life,

that's a pretty boring life
if you ask me.

You know? That's a life
that I don't wanna lead.

You don't know what's gonna
get thrown your way.

Yeah.

And... as much as it's okay

to not have the answers‐‐
Yeah.

You know, I definitely have
been in relationships where

one answer that I need to have
is I need to know

the other person
is on the same page.

Like, that their heart is on

- the same page as mine.
- Yeah.

- You know?
- Yeah.

With everything.

And Charles talked to me
about just‐‐

and he said that...

like, there could be a moment
where you pull away

just because you haven't had
these strong feelings.

Yeah.

Relationships are something
I take really seriously.

I don't play with this type
of stuff.

I don't play with love.
I don't play with emotions.

I don't play with feelings.

So... when it comes to you,

I am feeling things for you

that I've never felt
for anybody before.

It's easy for me
to close my eyes and then

picture a genuine life
with you.

So... falling in love
is one thing.

Mm‐hmm.

Being in love is another
thing.

Mm‐hmm.

And an engagement
is another thing.

Yeah. Yeah.

Which of those
are you ready for?

I mean, all three.

You know, like, falling
in love, being in love,

loving you.

There's something about you
that I am certain about.

I know I trust myself.
I trust you.

And I trust that I'm literally
falling in love with you.

And, um...

that's something I really wanna
hold onto.

An engagement
at the end of this

is something that I can see
myself doing.

And I've had time to‐‐
Mm‐hmm.

Like you, have sat
and thought about, like,

- "Am I ready for this?"
- Yeah.

And unwaveringly,
the answer is yes.

Do you feel like you
could get there?

Most definitely.

With you, yeah.

I don't see myself
running away.

Not at all.
You know what I mean?

Like, I'm gonna continue
telling you how I feel

and continue being vulnerable

and just putting myself
out there for you

because I'm falling
in love with you.

This is very real for me.

A huge weight has just been,
like, lifted off my heart.

Exactly.

Nayte, to tell me that he's
able to get to an engagement‐‐

it gave me clarity.

And now, any fears or doubts

that I was entering
the night with,

I feel like have been
resolved.

So...

This is for you to open.

All right.

Let's see.

"Michelle and Nayte,
we hope you enjoyed your day

"out at sea and making
new memories together.

"Should you choose to forego
your individual rooms,

"please use this key to stay
as a couple

in the Fantasy Suite.
Tayshia and Kaitlyn."

So how do you feel about
spending the night together?

Definitely would love
to do that.

Me too.

I gotta give a lot of credit
to Michelle

when it comes to helping me
kind of...

you know, take all this in
and kind of, like

let my guard down, too, because
I've never been in love before.

And to feel all
these new feelings

and to be around Michelle

and to know that, like,
feelings are mutual‐‐

I'm a very happy person.
Very happy person.

Wow.

I know that I deserve to be
in a relationship where

someone cares for me
as much as I care about them

and is in love with me as much
as I'm in love with them.

And tonight, he opened up

and shared his emotions
and his feelings

and that's when I kind of
felt safe with Nayte.

Okay.

Yeah, this is perfect.

When you hear those words
come out of Nayte's mouth,

it made me realize how long
I've been waiting to hear that

because, I mean,
those are powerful words.

I came here to fall in love,

and after this Overnight,
I may be in love with Nayte.

You know, last night was

probably one of the most
special nights I've had.

- Aww.
- I needed that.

I needed that with you.

It was a‐‐it was just a really
all‐around great night

from beginning to end.

Like, I'm, like,
so much closer to you.

Aww.

This is something that,
you know,

life could literally be,
um, and I want that.

You're something that I wanna
hold on to.

And, you know, falling in love
with you‐‐

I'm in love with you.

This is what I want.

So Nayte is in love?

Nayte is in love.

Um, I am definitely
in love with you too.

Last night going to bed,

Nayte and I talked about
how we were so

falling in love with
each other and have been.

But waking up this morning,

I was, like, "Okay, I'm in love
with this man."

There's just something so
special about our connection

and our chemistry
and I firmly believe

that this is what
a soulmate feels like.

I'm probably the happiest
human being alive right now.

- Aww.
- There's no doubt about it.

There's no doubt about it.

That's how you make me feel.

Last night was amazing.

You know, the conversations
that we had,

the moments that we spent
just being together,

you know, alone and having
that time together.

You know,
I was already feeling

so connected to Michelle

and the relationship
definitely got a lot stronger.

I'm just on‐‐
I just feel so good right now.

You know what I mean?

Like, I just feel so good
right now.

This feels so good‐‐

No way. No way.

- Are you kidding me?
- We are out here.

Wait, what?

♪ ♪

Oh, these guys are amazing.

♪ ♪

Oh, my God.

This is serious. Like,
this is actually happening.

Like, this could be my person.

And that's, like,
that is exciting.

I love this. I love this.

I don't know if I was
expecting to come out of this

with genuine love for
somebody, but this works.

That's my girl for sure.

It's crazy.

How do you think the night
went with Nayte?

I think it went good.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

But we'll find out.

We'll find out soon.

- What's up, guys?
- What's up, man?

- What up?
- How y'all doin'?

- How y'all doin'?
- Good. How are you?

- Good, how are you?
- I'm all right.

How was the date?

- Oh, it was great, man.
- It was great.

I definitely vibed out.

- Mm.
- Vibed out.

Kicked it.

Yeah.

You know, Nayte came back

and tells like he had
a great day.

And that does scare me.

So that just makes it
extremely more tough on her

to truly decide, like,
where her heart wants to go.

You know, I just feel like,
you know,

all her one‐on‐one dates
went really good

and I feel like, you know,

Michelle has a huge decision
tonight.

But, you know, I'm nervous
to say goodbye if I have to.

I'm still on a high
right now,

so I mean, I'm just looking
forward to this Rose Ceremony.

See, uh, how everything
plays out.

Yeah. Yeah.

My Overnight with Michelle
was so phenomenal,

I realize that there's nothing
more in this life

that I want other than
to be with Michelle.

So I'm nervous just 'cause

I haven't seen Michelle
in a couple days

and there are two other guys
here

who Michelle has super strong
feelings with.

I think my biggest fear
is losing Michelle

and losing, like,
the woman that I love

more than anything.

But there's no way I'm about to
stop fighting for this woman.

I'm feeling really happy

with where me and Michelle
are.

The connection I have with
Michelle just feels like home.

I'm falling in love with her.

I definitely can see, you know,
our future within reach.

I can see us going back home
to Minnesota together,

getting a house,
starting a family.

If today was the day
to go down on one knee,

I'd be ready. I'd be ready.

Every day I just
find myself, you know,

falling deeper and deeper
in love with Michelle.

And coming off of such
an amazing time,

I'm sure that she's still
kind of, you know,

feeling the energy
of last night, you know?

So going into
this Rose Ceremony,

I'm feeling quite confident.

But somebody's leaving here
heartbroken tonight.

Tonight is going to be

the hardest decision
that I've had to make.

I've now fallen in love with
all three men who are here,

which is something
I didn't think was possible.

And now I have to break
someone's heart.

And there's all these
complicated feelings

knowing how much that's going
to hurt them

because he's someone who
continues to put me first.

And I still have to
send him home

because I know that
it's the right thing to do.

But I know that as that
person's heart breaks,

my heart's gonna be
breaking too.

I have known this
for a while,

but this past week
of Overnights

has reaffirmed that
I have three incredible men

who are still left here.

You opening up your hearts
to me

and continuing to be
vulnerable with me

has really allowed
our relationships

to become so much
stronger this week.

You three have completely
changed my life.

You have impacted my heart
in a way

that I can't even describe.

And because of that,
this decision tonight

has my stomach in knots,

and it seems nearly impossible
to make.

Before we start, do you
think I could talk to you?

- Yes.
- Sorry.

I have no idea what's going on.

I don't know.

This is not
to scare you, I promise.

I promise, I promise.

I know tonight is gonna be

one of the most difficult
decisions

that you ever have to make.

And so, Michelle,

when I told you that I put
you first, I put you first.

When I told you that I love you

and when I told you
that you were truly

becoming my best friend,

that I truly mean that
I will be here for you

regardless of whatever
happens to me.

Thank you.

After her speech,

Brandon pulled her aside
really quick.

If I'm being completely honest,
it does bother me.

I think he's feeling
desperate.

Today might be
my last day,

but I just wanted to at least
look you in the eye

and just make sure that

the woman I love
more than anything is okay.

You know, you only ever
hail Mary when you're losing

and you're trying to just
squeeze in the win.

But the question is, like,
could it change her mind?

You know, especially
before she makes

a life‐changing decision
like this.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

I wanna make sure
that going into this

she has someone
and she's not doing it alone.

Like, even if I'm that one
being sent home,

there's no way that I'm gonna
leave this without

putting 100% into Michelle.

I just hope it's not me,

but as long as she follows
her heart,

that's all I truly care about.

I do feel strongly about
where my heart is.

So with that said,

I do wanna get
the Rose Ceremony continued.

Nayte.

Nayte, will you accept
this rose?

Always.

Brandon.

Brandon, will you accept
this rose?

I will.

Joe, I'm sorry.

If you wanna take a minute,
you can say goodbye.

- Good luck to you, brother.
- Al love.

Can I walk you out?

I'm sorry.

I feel like I've been
falling in love with you,

like I'm still falling in love
with you.

You understand a certain side
of me that nobody understands.

And I know how much you pushed
yourself to open up

and I care about you so much.

You have a piece of my heart

and I think you always will.

And I'm sorry.

I didn't want to break
your heart.

It's just...
I can't be your person.

As much as it hurts...

I know it's hurting you too.

And I might not be showing it
right now,

but I really did see
that future with you

that we talked about.

And I meant all those words
that I said to you

and even though I am definitely
sad of the outcome,

it's something I'll always
hold with me

for the rest of my life.

And I wanna thank you
for pushing me

to be more open
and to be more vulnerable,

to be the best person
that I can possibly be.

Thank you for coming here
for me.

I know it wasn't easy for you.

You have changed me so much

and you have brought
such a piece of home.

And I can't thank you enough
for that.

Can I walk you to the car?

Good luck.

I wish nothing but the best
for you, okay?

I'm in shock.

I'm in pretty big shock
right now.

I didn't see that coming.

I really thought
she was my person.

So I'm wondering what Brandon
said to her,

but I have no idea.

I have no idea.

You open your whole heart
and then...

Then this happens.

Kicked me good for sure.

I just wanna go home.

Coming up next week
on the emotional, live

three‐hour season finale
of "The Bachelorette"...

When you're in love
with two people,

how do you know which person
is your person?

Michelle's journey of love

comes to a dramatic
conclusion.

I found my forever person,

and all I think about
is sharing my life with her.

There's nothing else
I want more in the world

than Michelle.

I don't wanna go through life
without you.

My concern is that he would
become a jealous person.

I am very ready

- to get down on one knee.
- Are you?

I'm not sure
you're 100% in.

Do you feel like he's ready
for an engagement?

To be honest, um... no.

I deserve to be
in a relationship

where someone loves me
as much as I love them.

Here I am,
madly in love with you,

and it is terrifying.

There's nobody else
in this world

that I'd rather
give my heart to.

This could be it for me.

It's the shocking conclusion

you'll never expect.

This is the hardest decision

I've ever made.

It's all coming up
next Tuesday

on the season finale
of "The Bachelorette."

So I know that you...

have been the cow whisperer.

Right?

You were very nurturing

to these baby cows,

and they came right up to you,

so I wanna see you work‐‐

I wanna see you work
your horse magic.

Okay, let's do it.

I got all the snacks!

Come here!

Joe's taking this very
seriously.

I'm trying. Oh‐‐

Okay, wait, come here.

That one‐‐
He's not rockin' with me.

Ooh, that tickles.

Oh‐‐
Oh!

He's not playin'.

He's not...

- he's not horsing around.
- Want some?

- Yeah, this got...
- Are you good?

You need help?

This one's nice.

He, like, knows not to nibble
your fingers.
