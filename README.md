# The Bachelor Stats
This project's goal is to collect an display data all about the show "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette"

# Part 1: Searching the show's dialoge
In the data folder there are .txt files that hold transcripts to some episodes that I scraped from various resources online. There doesn't seem to be an easily accessable single location for all of the episodes, so the data will likely be incomplete for a while. (with 'complete' being every transcript from every episode S1-current)
The program will ask for a search term, then scan all of the txt files for matches. It then totals up the matches and creates a .csv as a list of each episode and the count of how many occurrences there are. 
This csv is used to create the bubble chart that is generated by plotly. The search term is displayed in the chart title.

# Part 2: Contestant Stats
*COMING SOON*

This will be a way to view all of the data from every contestant who has ever been on the show(s). Listing things such as their Name, Age, Occupation, Birthplace, etc.
